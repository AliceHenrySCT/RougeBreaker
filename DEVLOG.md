# RougeBreaker Development Log

A 3-week development journey creating a modern brick breaker game with React Native and Expo.

## Week 1: Foundation and Core Mechanics

**Objectives**: Establish project foundation and implement basic gameplay

**Major Accomplishments**:
- Set up Expo project with TypeScript and file-based routing
- Implemented physics engine based on [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af2-OT9mE14&t=1203s) with realistic ball movement and collision detection
- Created responsive paddle controls using React Native Gesture Handler
- Generated 60-brick wall with gradient color system (purple to blue)
- Added starfield background using custom Skia shaders

**Key Technical Implementations**:
```typescript
// Physics engine core
const move = (object: ShapeInterface, dt: number, maxSpeed: number) => {
  "worklet";
  object.vx += object.ax * dt;
  object.vy += object.ay * dt;
  object.x.value += object.vx * dt;
  object.y.value += object.vy * dt;
};
```

**Challenges Overcome**:
- **Ball Sticking Issues**: Fixed by adding buffer zones in collision detection
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Resolved Skia type definitions and path mapping
- **Gesture Conflicts**: Separated touch handling from physics calculations

**Technologies Integrated**: React Native Skia, Reanimated, Gesture Handler, Expo Router

## Week 2: Game Features and Progression

**Objectives**: Add game depth with scoring, power-ups, and progression systems

**Major Accomplishments**:
- Implemented comprehensive scoring system (100 points per brick)
- Created three-power-up system: Speed Boost, Extra Life, Extra Ball
- Added round progression and win/lose conditions
- Built multi-ball gameplay (up to 6 balls simultaneously)
- Implemented lives system with extra life power-ups (max 3 lives)
- Added data persistence with AsyncStorage for high scores and recent games

**Key Technical Implementations**:
```typescript
// Multi-ball spawning system
const spawnExtraBalls = () => {
  'worklet';
  const ballsToSpawn = Math.min(extraBallPowerUps.value, 5);
  for (let i = 0; i < ballsToSpawn; i++) {
    const extraBall = allExtraBalls[i];
    // Position and velocity setup with random variations
  }
};
```

**Challenges Overcome**:
- **State Synchronization**: Managed complex game state between UI and physics
- **Extra Balls Power-up**: Most challenging feature - could spawn extra balls but their movement wasn't being set properly. Required implementing delayed velocity copying and careful timing coordination
- **Multi-ball Physics**: Coordinated multiple ball objects with individual behaviors
- **Power-up Balance**: Designed strategic choices that enhance gameplay

**Features Added**: Leaderboard UI, power-up selection interface, score persistence

## Week 3: Polish and Difficulty System

**Objectives**: Create polished user experience with customizable difficulty

**Major Accomplishments**:
- Implemented three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard) with:
  - Ball speed variations (±15 from base)
  - Paddle size adjustments (±20% width)
  - Score multipliers (0.8x, 1.0x, 1.2x)
- Created immersive gameplay experience (hidden navigation during play)
- Added comprehensive settings panel with difficulty selection
- Optimized performance and fixed remaining collision bugs
- Enhanced UI/UX with smooth transitions and visual feedback

**Challenges Overcome**:
- **Platform Differences**: Handled Android navigation bar behavior inconsistencies
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved collision detection algorithms for smooth 60fps
- **Dynamic Properties**: Updated paddle size and ball speed without breaking physics

**Final Polish**: Removed unused haptic/sound systems, comprehensive documentation, code cleanup

## Project Summary

**Total Development Time**: 3 weeks
**Final Features**: Physics-based gameplay, 3 difficulty levels, power-up system, multi-ball mechanics, score persistence, immersive UI
**Technologies Mastered**: React Native, Expo, Skia graphics, Reanimated worklets, TypeScript
**Lines of Code**: ~2,000+ TypeScript

**Key Learnings**:
1. **Performance Matters**: Game development requires careful optimization for smooth gameplay
2. **State Management**: Complex games need well-structured state handling between UI and physics
3. **User Experience**: Small details like difficulty selection and gameplay decisions significantly improve engagement
4. **Platform Considerations**: Cross-platform development requires attention to platform-specific behaviors

**Final Result**: Complete, polished brick breaker game ready for app store deployment with engaging mechanics and high replay value.
